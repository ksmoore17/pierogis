# pierogis

`pierogis` is a framework for image and animation processing. Ingredients that describe image processing functions can be assembled
into recipes and used to cook an image or animation.

`pyrogis` is a python library and cli tool implementing this framework.

```bash
pip install pyrogis
pyrogis chef input.png "sort; quantize" -o output.png
```

## install

**install from a wheel with pip**

```sh
pip install pyrogis
```

Depends on `numpy` and `PIL`. PIL requires some external C libraries for handling image files. You probably don't have
to worry about this. If you do, try a `conda` installation.

To build from source (either the repository or the sdist), you will need to install the rust stable toolchain.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

pip install .
```

## features

- **CLI** - Use a `rich` cli to cook Ã  la carte recipes, or provide a recipe in a document
- **Animations** - Animations (gifs and movies) can be cooked in one command
- **Extendable** - Easy to create custom manipulations (see [package](#package))
- **Lazy Rendering** - Render a manipulation after constructing your pipeline (see [package](#package))
- **Numpy or Rust backend** - Image processing functions use Numpy for (python relative) fast operations. Some
  ingredients use compiled `Rust` for more speed.

## acknowledgements

The original python [pixelsort](https://github.com/satyarth/pixelsort) package inspired this package. While the
underlying [algorithm](https://github.com/kimasendorf/ASDFPixelSort) of that package and of `sort` in this one is
supposed to be functionally the same, details of the implementation may differ.

The quantizing algorithm used in this package is done with [`rscolorq`](https://github.com/okaneco/rscolorq), which
is a port of [`scolorq`](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dcoetzee/downloads/scolorq/), itself an implementation of
Spatial Color Quantization.

## issues and contributing

When you encounter an error, there are some guidelines that will make it easier to help you:

- Ensure that you are using the latest version of the package. It's early days so errors and updates will be frequent.
  Use `pip uninstall pyrogis` then `pip install pyrogis --no-cache-dir` to reinstall.
- Provide the version of `pyrogis` that you are using in issues to rule that out.
  `pip list` -> pyrogis \_.\_.\_
- Provide the traceback or error message if relevant.
- Provide your os and any other specific information about how you are trying to use the package.
- Provide the code or the cli command that triggered the error.
- If the problem is visual: that can be more difficult to debug. Share a link to an image hosting site if you want to
  share what you are seeing in an issue.
- If you are getting different behavior than you expect: that could be an error or a feature.
- If your problem is with installation: try conda, preinstall `numpy` and `pillow`, install the rust toolchain, and
  start praying. There will be a website with a visual editor for this software so stay tuned.

Hopefully all levels of skills can use this package. Any form of contributing is appreciated; passive-aggressive
semi-anonymous thumbs down is not appreciated.

Everyone using and contributing to this package is doing it for the love of the game.
