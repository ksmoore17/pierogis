This submodule defines a model of a kitchen for cooking `Pierogi` en masse.
The goal of this is to create an idiom for distributing cooking tasks.

It contains both a protocol of a `pierogis` *kitchen* and an implementation.

The protocol is based on `Server`, `Kitchen`, and `Chef` classes working together to
allow any mode of distributed computing, like multiprocessing, lambda, http, etc.

The implementation here uses `multiprocessing`.

The protocol defines an `OrderTaker` (`Server`) for handling a requests for
media to be cooked. The `OrderTaker` should transform this into an `Order` filled
with `Ticket` objects to describe each frame. The `Server` passes this off to
a `Kitchen` which decides how to cook the `Order`. Ultimately, a
`Cooker` (`Chef`) cooks the `Ticket` and a cooked `Pierogi` is produced.

- `Ticket`
  - Describes in a json-friendly format the input media, Ingredient objects,
    and instructions for a Recipe
- `Order`
  - A collection of many tickets and a desciption for handling the `Course`
    output as a whole
- `Server`
  - Interfaces with instructions provided in a parsable format, creating
    an `Order` for a `Kitchen` to process and checking its status
- `Chef`
  - Cooks a ticket and saves it to a specified location
- `Kitchen`
  - Cooks an `Order` using a `Chef`, possibly distributing the work
    (multiprocessing, etc.)
