pierogis
================

*image and animation processing framework*

   "``pierogis`` *is the name of the framework;*

   ``pyrogis`` *is the name of the python package and cli tool"*

   \- a wise man

Pixel arrays can be cooked with ``Ingredients`` such as ``sort``, ``quantize``, and ``resize``.
``Dishes`` can be made with ``Recipes`` of several ``Ingredients`` describing a pipeline to be applied to an image or frame.
``Courses`` can be made from a set of ``Dishes`` to compile an animation.

A cli wraps these operations and their parameterization in ``Fillings`` as listed on the ``menu``.

In this realm, a single ``Pierogi`` is a pixel, many ``Pierogi`` is an image, and ``Pierogis`` is many images.
